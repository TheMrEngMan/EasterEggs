## EasterEggs
Minecraft Spigot plugin for easter egg hunt, decompiled from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/eastereggs-1-7-1-16.39523/ using Luyten.

This version adds fixes for easter eggs not loading when Multiverse is used, and makes is so that players without `eastereggs.admin` permission cannot break easter eggs that have been placed (by players with that permission).
